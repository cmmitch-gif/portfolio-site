                <p>The primary goal with Minnows was to immerse myself in the practical aspects of marketing and design. I aimed to gain firsthand experience in ecommerce, social media marketing, and brand development. This was a sandbox for experimentation, where I could teach myself the ropes of running a business and build a solid skill set that would serve me well in future endeavors.</p>

Minnows essentially became a full-time endeavor, requiring dedication and creativity to manage all aspects of the brand's growth.</p>
