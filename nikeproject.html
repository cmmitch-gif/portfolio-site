                    When Nike approached Ultra Football with the exciting task of celebrating the launch of the Nike Air Zoom Mercurial, we knew it had to be big. The project revolved around creating an event that would not only spotlight this innovative boot but also celebrate Sam Kerr, with the prospect of elevating her status alongside football icons like Kylian Mbappe and Cristiano Ronaldo. As a key member of the team, I collaborated closely with Nike and our events agency to bring this vision to life.</p>

                    Our primary goal was to orchestrate an event that matched the grandeur of Nike's global celebrations. We aimed to elevate Sam Kerr's profile, showcasing her as a football superstar, while generating excitement and buzz around the new Mercurial Air Zoom boots. Ultimately, we wanted to drive record-breaking sales and create a memorable experience that resonated with fans and customers alike.</p>

                <h2>Action</h2>
                <p>
  
                    To achieve these ambitious goals, I partnered with Nike's global content team to meticulously plan Sam Kerr's activities throughout the evening. From engaging in interviews and interacting with young fans to participating in photoshoots and presenting awards, every moment was carefully crafted to capture her charisma and talent. On the night of the event, I led our internal content team, ensuring we met crucial deliverables under tight time constraints. Coordinating with photographers and videographers, we produced captivating social media content that was shared in real-time, amplifying the event's reach and impact.</p>

This project underscored our ability to deliver world-class events and content, setting a new benchmark for future collaborations.</p>
