                <p>Hi, I'm Mitchell, a digital marketer with a background in sports and a passion for human-centered design. I'm currently expanding my skills by studying UX design at RMIT, with a focus on creating user-friendly and engaging experiences. With a marketing degree and over 5 years of experience in the sports and lifestyle industry, I've honed my skills in content creation, social media, and campaign management.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of work I am a big sports fan (Fremantle & Villa are my teams) and try to consume a healthy amount of film, literature & music. I've listed some favourites below and will try to remember to update this when I come across something worthwhile üòÅ</p>

                            <p class="slide-description">I know I‚Äôm a bit late to the part on this one. I got to watch it in IMAX recently and was blown away. There is something present in the films about the Vietnam War that tap into horror / anti-war / anti-America themes that you don‚Äôt see across other war films.</p>

                            <p class="slide-description">I‚Äôm a massive Paul Thomas Anderson fan and loved his most recent movie. I found this such a sweet fun hangout film in the vein of dazed and confused, carried by the two lead performances. It probably has my favourite use of music in a film of all time.

                            <p class="slide-description">A Different Man was one of my favourites of 2024, and Sebastian Stan as the lead was probably my favourite acting performance of the year. It deals with a similar subject matter to The Substance but in a much more subtle and nuanced way (my opinion).

                            <p class="slide-description">Affected by Cara Wrigley & Karla Straker is such a great practical read for approaching digital channels and content from an audience‚Äôs perspective. There‚Äôs a great framework in here about designing your digital channels to hit an audience emotionally.

                                User Friendly is the best history of human-centered design out there. Its filled with really great examples throughout history where subtle changes in design has saved lives, improved people‚Äôs standard of living and of course made a lot of money.

                            <p class="slide-description">My partner bought me this for Christmas, it's such a thought-provoking read, speculating on the future of design and the role of designers in questioning assumptions and provoking debate.

                            <p class="slide-description">Mac Millers latest post-humous album is one that I‚Äôve been listening to. It feels a little experimental and not quite finished, but more Mac Miller music is always a good thing. ‚Äò5 Dollar Pony Rides‚Äô is a song I‚Äôd recommend.

                            <p class="slide-description">I‚Äôm not a big Travis Scott fan but Utopia is probably my favourite album from the last couple of years. Although I don‚Äôt like the person I do have a lot of respect for his creativity, the Circus Maximus movie he released alongside the album has some of the coolest music videos I‚Äôve ever seen.</p>
