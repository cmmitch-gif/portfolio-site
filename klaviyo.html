                <p class="project-intro">When I took over the Klaviyo account at Etrnl, my main aim was to transform our email strategy into a modern, personalized experience that would leave a lasting positive impression on our subscribers. This project was about more than just numbers; it was about connecting with our audience on a deeper level.</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Our goals were ambitious yet focused. We didn't just want to boost our email metrics; we wanted our subscribers to feel a genuine connection to our brand. Success would be measured not only by increased open rates and revenue but also by the number of repeat customers, indicating a stonger positive feeling towards the brand.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <h2>Action</h2>
                <p>To turn these goals into reality, we embarked on a comprehensive redesign of our email aesthetics and strategy. I developed a custom welcome series that segmented subscribers into three distinct categories: wedding, active, and lifestyle customers. This segmentation began at the sign-up page, where customers could choose their path. From there, they received tailored recommendations and personalized messaging that spoke directly to their interests and needs. This approach ensured that every email felt relevant and engaging, fostering a sense of connection and value</p>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>Our email metrics have surged across the board, with revenue up by $100,000 year over year. Every single metric has seen an uplift, underscoring the success of our personalized approach. Our campaigns now perform exceptionally well, indicating that customers are more inclined to make repeat purchases and remain loyal to our brand. This project has not only transformed our email marketing but has also strengthened our relationship with our customers, setting a new standard for how we communicate and engage.</p>
